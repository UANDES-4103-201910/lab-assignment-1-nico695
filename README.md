It goes from the most general aspects of the page to the specifics. <link > to use some type of refferal to the page. <tbody> and </tbody> groups all the things that are in between in a table. <tr> is used to select a specific row of the table, in this case, the table created by <tbody>. <td> itÂ´s similar to <tr> but <td> selects a specific cell of the table. <a> used to call a hyperlink and <img> to define an image, for example, the letter "Y" in the top left corner is an image related to the hyperlink linked to the home page. <span> mostly used to define a section of the page. <b> is for bold text.
